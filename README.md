## About TypeScript
TypeScript lets you write JavaScript the way you really want to. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It enables developers to add type safety to their projects. Moreover, TypeScript provides various other features, like interfaces, type aliases, abstract classes, function overloading, tuple, generics, etc.

## About Snowpack
Snowpack scans your website/application for all used npm packages. Snowpack reads these installed dependencies from your node_modules directory. Snowpack bundles all your dependencies separately into single JavaScript files.

## About the TODO Application
This is a todo application built using TypeScript and bundeled together with the help of Snowpack.
It consists of a form wherein you can input a task and add it to your list. A checkbox appears along with the task in your list. You can either check it or uncheck it (by default it is unchecked). The list gets stored on your local storage.
